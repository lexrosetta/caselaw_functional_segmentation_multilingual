Plaintiffs cont that t were interviewed and hi by Tang, see Gulliford Decl. Ex. F at 25:10-27:4; M. Aff. ~ 4­8 i Z. Yang Aff. ~4, that Tang was able to fire Shanghai Cafe err.ployees, see Chan Aff. ~ 25i Deng Aff. ~ 13i vlang Aff. ~ 12i 

M. Yang Aff ~[ 21; Z. Yang Aff. ~ 14, and threatened to fire plaintiffs Wang and M. Yang, see Wang Aff .• 12, M. Yang Aff. ~ 

34. Plaintiffs so assert that Tang supervised and cont led them as employees by, among other things, instructing them to clean the restaurant, see Deng Aff. ~ 12; M. Yang Aff ~ 36, telling a iffs how to serve customers, see Chan Aff .• 24i Wang Aff. ~ 12, what to cook and how it should be prepared, see Wang Aff .• 12j Z.

Tang contends that he was not aintiffs' employer because 

did not own Shanghai Cafe. also argues that his activities in the restaurant, scribed above I were mere recommendations to pI iffs about how to perform their jobs and not managerial control, that plaintiffs have no 

documentary evidence, such as performance uations or policy manuals, that support their claim that Tang controlled the conditions of their employment. Nonetheless, a jury could find, based on plaintiffs' testimony, that Tang was plaintiffs' employer under the economic reality test. Accordingly, Tang's motion for summary judgment on that ground is denied. 

Tang also argues that he lS entitled to summary judgment on his defamation counterclaim nst Chan and M. Yang for distributing a flier that accused Tang of stealing Shanghai Cafe employee tips, because Tang did not steal employee tips. Chan and M. Yang contend that Tang thheld their tips, see Chan Aff. ~~ 10-14; M. Yang Aff. ~~ 17 23, and thus there is a genuine dispute unsuitable for resolution by judgment as a matter of law.

B. 

Deluxe moves for summary judgment that does not have successor liability, that Z. Yang is precluded from recovery, and that plaintiffs' claims are statutorily barred. 

1. 



Deluxe cont that it cannot be held liable for Shanghai Ca 's debts because it is not a successor corporation to Shanghai Cafe. Plaintiffs argue that Deluxe and Shanghai met the requirements for a de facto merger, and that there is a substantial continuity of identity between Deluxe and Shanghai Ca 

"A de facto merger occurs when a transaction, although not form a merger, is in substance a 'consolidation or merger of seller and purchaser.'ff 



Partner, 352 F.3d at 45, Schumacher, 451 N.E.2d at 198. A "de facto merger is 'analyzed In a fl 





e manner that sregards mere questions of form and 

whether, in substance, it was the intent of the successor to absorb and continue the operation of the predecessor.,n Time Warner Cable Inc. v. Networks LLC, 09 Civ. 10059 (DLC) , 

~~-~----------~---~----~-----------~~~~~-­

2010 WL 3563111, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2010), 



Nettis 

v. Levitt, 241 F.3d 186, 194 (2d Cir. 2001). To t whether a de facto merger occurred, "courts consider (1 ) continui of ownership; (2) cessation of ordinary business by the predecessor; (3) assumption by the successor of liabilities ordi ly necessary for continuation of the predecessor's business; and (4) cont ty of management, personnel [ physical location, assets, and general business operation." Nettis, 241 F.3d at 193 94 (applying New York law) . 

In opposition to Deluxe's motion, pIa iffs present 

evidence of each element to support finding de facto merger. 

It is undisputed that Grace Lau was an owner of Shanghai Cafe, but the parties dispute whether Lau is al so an owner of Deluxe: plaintiffs argue that Deluxe's undated Board of Director Minutes, Gulliford Aff. Ex. L at 1420-22, demonstrate that Lau owns 40 shares, or 20%, of Deluxe, whereas Deluxe relies on contrary documents that indicate Lau is not an owner. 

There is no spute that Shanghai Ca ordinary business in June 2010. 

Plaintiffs argue that Deluxe assumed the liabilities ordinarily necessary for continuation of the Shanghai Cafe's business because Deluxe made payments on the Shanghai Ca accounts at Con Edison for electricity, see id. Ex. N at BEA01493, at Crown for commercial garbage collection, see id___ , at Ecolab for kitchen equipment, see id., and at AT&T for telephone service, see id. at BEA01491. Deluxe argues that it did not assume any of Shanghai Cafe's liabilit s because there was no formal transaction between the two entities by which Shanghai Cafe assigned Deluxe its 



s and liabilities, and the debts satisfied by Deluxe were minimal and for generic services. 

Plaintiffs also argue that there was cont ty of management, 



physical location, assets, and general 

business operation between Shanghai Cafe and Deluxe because they 

present evidence that Lau, Shanghai Cafe's former manager and owner, is also the manager and an owner at Deluxe, which emp at least ten employees that formerly worked for Shanghai see Gulliford Aff. Ex. L at 178 :22 179 :20, that De operates out of 100 Mott Street, the same location that Shanghai Ca previous did, uses the same equipment and supplies as Shanghai Cafe, and uses the same menu, serving the same shes, as Shanghai Ca 

Although Deluxe argues that aintiffs mischaracterize the evidence, that issue is of one of factual interpretation, and there is a genuine dispute as to whether Deluxe absorbed and continued the operation of Shanghai Cafe, see Nettis, 241 F.3d at 194, as Shanghai Cafe's successor. Deluxe's motion for summary judgment on that ground is denied. 

2. Deluxe contends that because "there is evidence to suggest 

Plaintiff Zu Guo Yang (here fter " aintiff Yang" ) occupied a position at Shanghai Cafe such that he can be considered an employer,/! De 's Br. at 32, he is "barred from bringing any claims under the FLSA or New York 1 laws,/! id. 

Even if Z. Yang is an employer under federal law, Deluxe does not specify how such a finding would bar him from recovery, nor can the Court find any such authority. 

The 	FLSA does exempt from coverage "any employee employed 

a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capaci as such terms are defined and limit by regulations of the Secretary [of Labor] ," see 29 U.S.C. § 213 (a) (1) . The 



ations promulgated by Secretary of Labor define such an employee as an employee: (1) who is "Compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than 55 per week," (2 ) "Whose primary duty is management of the enterprise in which the employee is employed or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof," (3 ) "who customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees," and (4) "Who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendat as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular we " See 29 

C.F.R. §§ 541.100. The requirements are substantially similar 

under 	New York state law . See Torres v. Gris . , 628 F.Supp.2d 447, 455 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) . 





To the extent that Deluxe seeks to argue that Z. Yang falls within the FLSA's "white collar" exemption by suggesting his claims are barred because of his status as "a manager and employer Shanghai Cafe I" Deluxe's Repl. at 17, there is no evidence that that Yang was paid on a salary basis at a rate of 

$455 per week or more, or that Yang was responsible for ring 

and firing other employees at Shanghai Cafe. Deluxe's motion for summary judgment on this ground is denied. 

3 . 

The FLSA covers s of an ent se "whose gross volume of sales made or bus ss is not less than $500,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level that are 

ly stated) ," 29 U.S.C.A. § 203 (s) (1) (A) (ii) . Deluxe moves for summary judgment that Shanghai Cafe d not meet the $500,000 statutory shold. 

Plaintiffs contend that Shanghai Cafe was a cash business, see Z. Yang Aff. , 6, and argue that "deposit receipts produced by Bank of East Asia demonstrate that Shanghai Cafe had annual gross sales exceeding the statutory limit of $500,000. For example, for the running twelve months prior to Shanghai Cafe's demise, from June 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010, ca its to Shanghai's Bank of East Asia account totaled $667,592.98," and "Shanghai Cafe paid its vendor invoices and a majority 

its wage obligations wi cash from its registers," Pls' Br. at 28-29. There is a genuine dispute as to whether Shanghai Cafe's annual sales satisfy the statutory threshold, that must be 

I

resolved at al. Accordingly, De S mot ion for summary judgment on this ground is denied. Deluxe's motion summary judgment (Dkt. No. 114) is denied. 

So ordered.
