The Complainant, Yunhee Kim. a former employee of Respondents, collectively SK Hynix, tiled a complaint alleging SK Hynix violated the whistleblower provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 806 or SOX), 18 U.S.C. § 1514A (2010), 1 a8 nmended, and its impl€mcnting regulations ut 2fl C.F.R.

SOX pro,~des: (a) Vil"histlehlowcr Protection fo1· Employccb of Publicly Traded Cumpanies.-- Nu company with a class of sccurilie~ registered under scctjun 12 of the Securities t:xchange Act of 1934 (15 U.R.C. 78[), or that is !'equfred tu file ,-~ports under section l6(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 19.14 {l6 U.S.C. 78o(d)) including any subsidiary or affiliate whoso financial information isPart 1980 (2019). The complaint was referred to a Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for hearing. SK Hynix filed a motion to dismiss, which the AL.J denied. SK Hynix filed this petition for interlocutory review of theALJ's dismissal. As discussed below, SK Hynix has demonstl'ated no basis for dcpartmg from the Board's general practice of refusing to accept interlocutory appeals; we DENY Respondent',:; petition for interlocutory review.


On December 13, 2018, Respondent SK Hynix filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The ALI initially granted SK Hynix's motion to dismiss hut allowed Kim to amend her complaint. Kim filed her first amended complaint alleging additional coverage facts. Citing Syluester v. Pare.wl Intl. LLC. ARB No. 07-123, ALJ No. 2007-SOX-039, -042 (ARB May 25, 2011), the ALJ also ordered supplemental briefing as to the applicability of Twombly I lqba/2 to SOX's ploading requirements.

On May 17, 2019. SK Hynix again moved to dismiss, alleging that Kim's direct employer. SK Hynix Memory Solutions, is not subject to SOX's whistlchlower protection provisions because it is not covered under SOX and thus the Department of Labor docs not have subject matter jurisdiction.

On November 4, 2019, the ALJ denied SK Hynix's motion. SOX covers publicly traded companies and subsidiaries and affiliates whose financial information is consolidated with public companies.'1 The ALJ defined '•affiliate'' as included m the consolidated financial statements of su~h company. or nationally recognir.ed statistical mting orgamzatwn (as del'mcd in section :>(a) of the Securities J<:xchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c), or any officer, employee. contractor, subwntract.or, nr agent of such company or nationally recognized statistical rating organiiatinn, may d1schargP., demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and rnnditions of employment. because of any lawful act done by tho omployee-- (21)09).

' SOX prov1do6: '• .. .includmg any subsidiary 01· affiliate whose financial information is included in the cnnsohdated financial statements of such company, ... " 18 L' S.C. § 1514A In the March 18. 2019 Order Granting~loLion to Dismiss and Leave to Amend, the ALJ one who "controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an issuer of a security." /\Ll Nov. 4 Order at 4. Treating the motion a8 a threshold merits motion and not one of jurisdiction, the ALJ concluded that the issue of "control" is fact- dPpcndent and that Complainant had met her pleading standard to procend to discovery or hearing. Citing /\RB precedent, the ALJ concluded that the standard set forth in Twombly I Iqbal is not applicable to ALJ proceedings. Id. at 3.



The Secretary of Labor and the Board have held many times that interlocutory appeals are generally disfavored. There is a strong pofo,'Y ll.gainst piecemeal appeals. Turin u. Amtrust Fin. Servs., Inc., ARB No. 17-004, ALJ ~o. 2010-SOX-018, slip op. at :l (ARB Apl'. 20, 2017). Like the federal appellate courts, the Board applies the finality requirement in the interest of "combin[ing] in one review all stages of the proceeding that effectively may be reviewed and corrected if and when" the administnitive law judge issues a decision on the merits of the case.

Greene v. Env'tl Prot. Agency. ARB No. 02-050, AL.J ~o. 2002-SWD-001, slip op. at 4 (ARB Sept. 18, 2002). Nonetheless, the ,\RB is authorized to grant such orders in its discretion when exceptional circumstances warrant such process. Secretary'sOrder No. 01-2019, Secretary's Order, para. fi (Delegation of Authoritv andAssignment of Responsibility to the Administrative Review Board), 84 Fed. Reg. 1:1,072 (April :-1, 2019) ("Secretary's Order") (delegating to the Board "discretionary authority to review interlocutory rulings in exceptional circumstances, provided such review is not prohibited by statute").

When a party seeks interlocutory review of an ALJ's order, the ARB has eleded to look to the procedures found at 28 U .S.C. § 1292(bJ'I to determine whether noted that SK Telecom, a publidy traded company, owns 20.1'¼, of SK Hynix"s sh,ucs and SK llynix's information is consolidakd with SK Telecum's financial btatements.

When a distrid judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwrne appcalable under thib bOCtion, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question nflaw as to which there i~ substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the ordur ma~ materially advancR the ultimate t,,,·mination of rhe litigation, he shall w ~tate in writing in such order. '!'he Court of App~ah which wnuld have jul'isdiction of an appeal of such action may th<·rcupon, in itb ,libcretion. purmit an appeal to be taken from such order, ifapp]ieation is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order .... to accopt an interlocutory appeal for review. Office of Fed. Contract Compliance Programs u. ,JPMorgan Chase & Co., ARB No. 17-063, ALJ No. 2017-0FC-007 (ARH Oct. 5, 2017); Nichols Tree Farms, ARB No. 16-008, ALJ Nu. 2015-TAE-013 (ARB Jan. 19, 2016).

To sHtisfy the statutory prerequisites for section§ 1292(b) review, the party ,;eeking Huch review of an order which is not final must establish (1) that the order involves a controlling question oflaw. (2) there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion in resolving the issues pre~ented by the order, and (3) an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. JPMorgan Chase, ARB No. 17-063, slip op. at 6.

In its petition for interlocutory appeal, SK Hynix claims that the ALJ did not correctly apply the definition of ·'control" applicable to securities laws. Petition for Inter. App. at 3.4_ SK Hynix claims Kim's amended complaint has failed to plead any facts that a publicly tradod corporation controlled Kim's employer, SK Hynix Memory Solutions. SK Hynix also challenges the ALJ's ruling that Twombly I Iqbal pleading standards do not govern SOX'H pleading standards. In support of its petition, SK Hynix argues its appeal of the :November 4 Order (1) presents a "controlling question" of law, (2) for which there is substantial difference of opinion, and (3) may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. Petition for Inter. App. at 4.

The first step in the interlocutory appeal process is to have the ALJ certify the interlocutory issue for appellate review. Johnson v. U.S. Bancorp, ARB No. 11· 018, ALJ No. 2010-SOX-037, slip op. ttt 4 n.15 (ARB Mar. 14, 2011) ("The whole point of§ 1292(b) is to create a dual gatekeeper system for interlocutory appettls: Both the district court and the court of appeals must agree that the case is a proper candidate for immediate review before the normal rule requiring a final judgment will be overridden.") (quoting In re Ford l>dotor Co., ,344 F.3d 648, 654 (7th Cir. 2003)); see also Gunther v. Deltek, ARB Nos. 12-097, 12-099; ALJ No. 2010-SOX-049 (ARB Sept. 11, 2012). The ALJ denied SK Hynix's motion to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal. Dec. 12, 2019 Order Denying Request to Certify.



The ARB has held that a party failing to receive a certification may proceed under the "collateral order" exception the Supreme Court recognized in Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 3:17 U.S. f:i41 (1949). See Turin, ARB No. J 7.Q04, slip op. at 3. Under the collateral order doctrine. an appellate board may entertain interlocutory review if the decision appealed belongs to that "small class [of decisions] which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights a~serted in the action, too important to be denied review and too mdependcnt of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated."5 To fall within the "collateral order" exception, the order appealed must "conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and bP e!Tectively unrevicwablc on appeal from a final judgment." Thompson u, BAA Indianapolis, LLC, ARB .No, 06-061, ALJ No. 2005-AIR-032 (ARB June 30, 2006), quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978).

We presume SK Hynix docs not argue the collateral order exception rPquirements, because the AL,J's denial of SK Hynix's motion to dismiss does not involve a collateral order or any type of final decision. See, e.g., JPMorgan ChaRe, ARD l\'o. J 7-063, slip op. at 6 quoting Kilburn v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 376 F.3d 1123, 1133 (D.C. Cir. 2004) ("Denial of a motion to dismi,;s for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) is not ordinarily subject to interlocutory appe11l. It is neither a final decision nor a proper subject for appeal under the "collateral order" doctrine. Whether conclusive or not, it plainly is not separate from the merits."). Contrary to the finality required by the collateral order doctrine, theAL,J's order merely denied SK Hynix's motion to dismiss in favor of further proceedings. 6 SK Hynix and Kim are free to argue the merits of the AL,J's decis10n on appPal from the ALJ's decision.

' Heckman u. M3 Tl"ansp. LLC, ARB No. 16-083, A.LJ No. 20U-STA•059, slip op. ut 2 (ARB Nov. 10, 2016), quoting Cohen, 337 U.S. at 516; see also Mohawk Indus. u. Carpenter, of sovereign immunity, for "xample. Jungquist 11, Sheikh Sultan Rin Kltali/a Al Nahyan, effectively unreviewable on appeal \Jecause '8overeign immunity is an immunity from tri,!l and thu attendant burdens of litigation, and not just a defense to liability on the merits.•~.



Having foiled to demonstrate '·exceptional circumstances" for interlocutory review SK Hynix has faii<c1d to establish a basis for departing from the Board's general rule ag-ainst accepting interlocutory appeals. Accordingly, SK Hynix's petition for inWrlocutory review is DENIED.

SO ORDERED.
