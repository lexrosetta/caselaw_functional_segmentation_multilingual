 The Complainant, Aziz Aityahia, filed a retaliation complaint under the employee protection provision of the Wendell H. Ford AviationInvestment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21)1 with the Department ofLabor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). ComplainantPart 1979 (2018). alleged that Respondent Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) was complicit in the termination of his employment with Mesa Airlines (Mesa) on May 10, 2013, and also in Mesa’s refusal to rehire him in 2017. OSHA concluded Complainant suffered an adverse employment action when he was terminated in 2013, but dismissed the complaint because it was not filed within 90 days of the alleged adverse action. The case was referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) atComplainant’s request. The ALJ granted Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss, holding that the OALJ lacked jurisdiction to consider complaints under Section 11(c) of theOccupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. § 660(c) (1970) (OSH Act) and that the complaint under the whistleblower provisions of AIR 21 was untimely. OrderGranting Motion for Summary Decision (Feb. 14, 2019). Complainant filed a petition requesting that the Administrative Review Board (ARB or the Board) review the ALJ’s order. We granted that petition and now affirm.



The Administrative Review Board has jurisdiction to review the ALJ’s AIR 21 decision pursuant to Secretary’s Order No. 01-2020 (Delegation of Authority andAssignment of Responsibility to the Administrative Review Board (Secretary’s discretionary review of ARB decisions)), 85 Fed. Reg. 13,186 (Mar. 6, 2020). TheARB will affirm the ALJ’s factual findings if supported by substantial evidence, but reviews all conclusions of law de novo. Summary decision is permitted when “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to decision as a matter of law.” 29 C.F.R. § 18.72(a) (2018). On appeal from summary decision, we review the record on the whole in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Micallef v. Harrah’s Rincon Casino & Resort, ARB No. 2016-0095, ALJ No.

2015-SOX-00025, slip op. at 3 (ARB July 5, 2018).


The ALJ’s determination that there is no evidence that ALPA was complicit in Mesa Airlines’ decision to rehire Complainant is correct. For the reasons stated by the ALJ, there is no genuine dispute  of material fact that Respondent might have taken   an  adverse action against Complainant, a required element for relief.

We agree that the ALJ correctly dismissed the claim.2 Moreover, the ALJ correctly concluded that Section 11(c)(2) of the OSH Act does not provide an administrative appellate remedy for complaints  that are dismissed by the Secretary of Labor.

Thus, we ADOPT the ALJ’s well-reasoned order Ruling on Respondent’s Motion toDismiss as the final agency decision in this matter and ATTACH a copy hereto.

SO ORDERED.
