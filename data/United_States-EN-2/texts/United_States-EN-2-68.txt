Before:  James A. Haynes, Heather C. Leslie, and James D. McGinley,Administrative Appeals JudgesDECISION AND ORDER

PER CURIAM. Rhonda McIntyre complained that the Respondent, her employer Pope Funeral Homes, fired her in violation of the employee protection provisions of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, Section 1057 of theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA or Act) and its implementing regulations.1 Complainant filed a complaint pursuant to the CFPA’s employee protection provisions with the Department ofLabor’s (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA dismissed the complaint and Complainant requested a hearing. Respondent filed a motion for dismissal of Complainant’s complaint and Complainant opposed.  TheAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ) instead treated the motion as a motion for summary decision, allowing the parties to submit evidence and arguments regarding whether Respondent was a “covered person” or “service provider” under the CFPA. The ALJ issued an Order Granting Summary Decision and DenyingComplaint on April 30, 2019, having determined that Respondent was entitled to summary decision because Respondent is not a “covered person or service provider” under the CFPA.

JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW

The Secretary of Labor has delegated to the ARB authority to hear appeals from ALJ decisions and issue agency decisions in cases arising under the CFPA.

Secretary’s Order No. 01-2020 (Delegation of Authority and Assignment ofResponsibility to the Administrative Review Board (Secretary’s discretionary review of ARB decisions)), 85 Fed. Reg. 13,186 (Mar. 6, 2020). The ARB reviews questions of law presented on appeal de novo, but is bound by the ALJ’s factual determinations as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. 29 C.F.R.

§1978.110(b); Jacobs v. Liberty Logistics, Inc., ARB No. 2017-0080, ALJ No. 2016-STA-00007, slip op. at 2 (ARB Apr. 30, 2019) (reissued May 9, 2019) (citation omitted).  Summary decision is permitted where “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to decision as a matter of law.” 29C.F.R. § 18.72(a) (2018). On summary decision, we review the record on the whole in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Micallef v. Harrah’s RinconCasino & Resort, ARB No. 2016-0095, ALJ No. 2015-SOX-00025, slip op. at 3 (ARBJuly 5, 2018).

DISCUSSION

The CFPA prohibits a “covered person” or “service provider” from terminating or in any other way discriminating against any covered employee because such employee engages in any of the protected activities identified under 12 U.S.C. § 5567(a)(1)-(4) (emphasis added). Specifically, a “covered person or service provider” under the CFPA engages “in offering or providing a consumer financial product or service.”2In granting Respondent’s motion for summary affirmance, the ALJ considered Complainant’s arguments and evidence in a light most favorable to her. product or service”).

After analyzing the statute and regulations, the ALJ determined that Respondent’s motion should be granted. On appeal, Complainant raises several issues the ALJ addressed including that Respondent had affiliates; did extend credit; did extend and service loans; and did provide custodial bank deposits, and that the ALJ erred in granting respondent’s motion for summary decision. We point Complainant to theALJ’s sound analysis, which we adopt, outlining why none of her arguments are availing. We also note that Complainant argues the ALJ first failed to address her argument that Respondent provides financial services pursuant to 12 U.S.C § 5481 (15)(A)(i). Title 12 is titled “Banks and Banking” and references a number of financial institutions including banks, mortgage companies, credit unions and the like. Notably, Funeral Homes are not listed or referenced. As the ALJ thoroughly explained, taking into consideration the undisputed facts and the evidence submitted by the Complainant in a light most favorable to her, there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Respondent was a covered person or service provider which would make Respondent eligible for  the whistleblower protections of the CFPA.

CONCLUSION

Upon review of the ALJ’s Order Granting Summary Decision and Denying the Complaint and the parties’ arguments, we conclude that the ALJ’s decision is in accordance with the law and is well-reasoned. As a result, we ADOPT andATTACH the ALJ’s decision.

Accordingly, the ALJ’s Decision and Order dismissing McIntyre’s complaint isAFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.
