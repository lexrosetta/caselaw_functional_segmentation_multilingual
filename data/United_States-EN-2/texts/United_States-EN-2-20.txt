FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

This case arises unde,r the, Energy Re()rganization Aet of 1974 (ERA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 5851 (2005), and as implemented hy regulations codified at 29 C.F.R. .Part 24 (2019). The Compillinrmt, Laurent ,J. Brown, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) alleging that his employer, BWSR, LLC. the ReHpondent, terminated his employment after he engaged in protected activity, in violation of the ERA's whiHtleblower provisions. OSH..A.. found that there was no reasonable cause to believe that BV.'SR violated the ER.A's whistleblower provisions because Complainant did not make a prima facie showing that his work refusal was protected activity under the ERA. Complainant requested a hearing before an Admmistrative Law Judge (."i.LJ), who granted Respondent's motion for summary decision because Respondent is not an "employer" under 42 U.S.C .. ~~r:il(a)(2). 1 We affirm, adopting and attaching the ALJ's order.

,JURTSDICTION AND STA ... '\/DARD OF REVIEW

The Secretary of Labor has delegated to the Administrative Review Hoard (ARB) authority to review ALJ decisions in cases arising under the ERA and issue finnl agoncy decisions in these matters.~ The ARB reviews an A.LJ's grant of summary decision de novo, applying the same standard that ALJs employ.3 Pursuant to 29 C .. F.R. § 18.72 (2019), summary decision must be entered if the pleadings, affidavits, material obtained by discovery, or matters officially noticed show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a party is entitled to summary decision.

DISCUSSION

Upon review of the ALJ's grant of summary decision, we conclude that it is a reasoned ruling based on the undisputed facts and the applicable law. The ALJ properly concluded that Respondent falls under the exclusion in the statute at §5851(a)(2)(ll) such that it is not an employer under the ERA because it is a subcontractor covered hy Executive Order 12344. Thus, the ALJ properly concluded that Respondent has e~tablishcd that there is no isdue as to a genuine issue of material fact and is entitled to summary decision as a matter of law.

Accordingly, we adopt and attach the ALJ's Order Granting Respondent's .Motion for Summary Decision.

This is a claim arising under employee protection provmons of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5851 r'ERA" or the "Act''), and the implementing regulations (29 C.F.R. Part 24). Laurent Brown (''Complainant") seeks recovery from BWSR (~Respondent'") fur retaliation resulting in his terminaiion on January J 7, 2018.

Procedural Hisrorv

The Complainant filed a a.,mplaim with the ()ccupMional Safety and Heallh Administration {"OSHA") on or around Jone 28, 2018, alleging that he was wrongfully tenninated from Iris employment at BWSR in retaliation fur refusing to provide "door guard" training to 4 individuals based on !he bclieflhat the actioru. would violate written safety policies for the training of building guards. On January 4, 2019, OSHA sent Complainant its findings dismissing the claim, finding that the Complainant could not establish a primafade case of retaliation. The findings state that the "Respondent is an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C § 5851.~ On January 13, 2019, the Complainant timely filed an objection to OSHA's findings and rcql.le!ted a hearing before the Office of Administrative Law Jud~.

On April 24, 2019, the Respondent filed a Motion for Summary Decision arguing that it is not a covered ffllployer Wider the regulalioru because it is a suhcornractor to the Department of Energy ("DOE") covered under Executive Order 12344 ("ER. Mot.~). In support of itsMotion, the Respondent submitted a declaration from BWSR's President, David M, Brown Jr, ("Brown Dec,"). On April 27, 2019, the Complainant filed a Memorandum in Opposition to Respondent's Motion fo,- Summa.y De<:ision. arguing that the Respondent was a covered employer based on OSHA's statement in its Ja,,uary 4 201 9 fmding-;. CCL. Resp.7.

Finding of Undisputed Facts

The Respondent is a subcontractor to Flunr Marine Propulsions, LLC ("FMPn). (Brown Dec. 1 4). Prior to 201&. the Respondent was a subcontractor fur Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation ("BMPC''). (Brown Dec. FT I). BMPC and FMP are contractors for the DOE Oflkc of Naval Reactors. (Brown Dec. 1 4, FT \). The Office of Naval Reactors is a ~i>~ together with the.US. Navy, has the responslbllity fur the opemtion of the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program, fonnally the Naval Nuclea, Propulsion Program {"NNPP''). {Brown Dec. 'i' S). This authority was given to the DOE in Executive Onb lll44 Sec. 5, and codified into law at 50 U.S.C. § 2511, 50 U.S.C. § 2406 and42 U.S.C. § 715&. As a subcontractor fur BMPC and FMP, the Respondent provided decomaminalion and decommissioning and facility upgrade coostni<:tion at four '.'lava] Reactor Facilities, including a facility in Idaho FaHs, Idaho. (Brown Dec. 'f 6). The Idaho Falls Sa,-al R<actor Facility houses the Expended Core Facility, wbere spent nuclear fuel frOOl Sa>-·y .-cssds is contailled. Id. The Complainant was employed by BWSR Imm Man:b 2, 2015 lllllil llllUIIIIY 18, 2018. (Brown Dec. , 10).

Libuly Wbby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,Disfuss;on Md Applicable:; Law discriminating against an employee with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because engaged in protected activity as described in the regulation. The regulation goes on to define an "employer" as:

. 2.

- {A) a licensee of the Commission or ofan agreement State under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021); {B) an applicant for a license from the Commission or such an agreement State; (C) a contractor or suboontraclor of such a licensee or applicant; {D) •contractor"' subcontractor of the Department of Energy that is indemnified by the Department under section 170 d- of the Atomic Energy Acl of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210(d)). bal sad! - slwl- illdade uy eoatrttlor or nboDLtll- oowaedl,JEnallffOrda-Ne. l.UU; (E) a contractor or subcontractor of the Commisoioo; (F) the Commission; and (G) the Oq,artrnentofEnergy.

The parties do not dispute that the Respondent fails to me<:t the defmition of~anploya'" contained in§§ 5&5l(a)(2)(A). (B), (C), (E), (F), or (G). (Brown Dec. 'I" 13, 14, IS. 17_ 13. 19; ER. Mot. at 4-5; CL. Resp. at 12). At issue is whether the Respondent is an employer under § 585!(a)(2XI)).

The Respondent argues that because it ls a subcontractor on a contract received front the Office of Naval Reactors it is covered by Executive Order 12344, and thus cannot be considererl an "employertt under§ 585l{n)(2){D). In 1992, Congress pas,;ed the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act, which in pertinent part, amended the ERA whistleblower regulacioru; to provide coverage for private eontractors and subcontractors oflhe DOE. Pub. L. 102-486 §2902. However, the 1992 amendments expressly excluded coverage for "any cootractor or subcontraclot covCTed by Executive Order No. 12344.n Pan of the plain languog<: definilim. oi "covcrn is "to deal with» or ''be the subject of.»1 Accordingly, I find that a plain U,tup,dalion of the 5851 (a){2)(D) is that the term "employer» does not include any contractor or Sllbcontractor of the OOE that deals with work tha1 is the subject of Executive Order 12344. I find that BWSR is snch a subcontractor.

Executive Order 12344 assigns the Office of Nava! Reactors the responsibility to di=t and supervise work at naval nuclear reactor facilities. (Soc_ 5). BWSR is a subcontractor for BMPC and FMP and these companies contracted with the Office of Naval Reactors to provide services rela1iog to decommissioning, decontaminating and construction at four naval nuclear reactor facilities, including the facility in Idaho Falls, Idaho. I find that the services provided byBWSR for the Office of Naval Reactors are for work Iha\ ;, lh~ :,ubject of Executive Order Complainanl does not dispute that BWSR is a subcontractor for the DOE oml has n<>rc.1 tilat the prime cnn(,--acts held by Bechtel Marine Propul.sion and Fluor Marine Propulsion were made with the DOE departrnootcreated by J:oxccutivc Order 12344. (CL. Resp. at 6-7).

The Complainant points ro OSHA' s Janllaf) 4. 2019 findings that state the "Re,por.dcnl is an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C § Sll51"' to support his argument that the Respondent is an ·'cmployCT" under the Act. However, an Admini,,1:rlll.ive Law Judge must provide a de ""''" TCVicw of the rerord, and once a furma.l hearing is requested the OSIIA findings arc no! binding. Hobby v. Georgia Pawer Co., 90-ERA-30 (S~c'y Aug. 4, l99S): Billmg8_v. Termwee.Valley ,1111/u,,ity, 91-ERA-12 (ARB June 26. 1996) (noring that Wagco- Hvu,'s findings were not binding because the regulali"n' acu>nl complauaants a right m de novo heari,.gs). Ftl,:ther, I find that the Secrt:tary's findings frul to adeqmtl:e\y address the j<;.sues raised by the partie.s" lllld a:re not well reasoned or well documcntcJ enough ro provide any a,gumcnt for why the Respondent would he a covered employer under the regulations.

In considering all the evidence of rerord, I find lha1 the Respondent falls within the exclusion created in the regulations a! § 585t(a}{2)(D) and is not an ~employer" as that term i, <lermed by the Act. Even construing a!I makrial in the light most favorable ID 1t>c Complainant, then, r,cists M factual issues that preclude summ~· decisiM in &,;or of lhe Respundcnl.

Conclu<m

In onl.cr fir the c,.,,ph- - to pre.-.il ua ,;lmn, il must be brou&ht against an "employer~ as Iha! 1<:no is d,:ii,,aJ •ilhio the~. In COIJSJdering the factual a.ssertrnns of the parties and !heir arguax:ot5-, I find lhal !IE RMI•=• I;, a subcontractor for the DOE Office of Naval Rearnn, whose ...,,.t;: inrhdes providing !1aYia:5 to naval nuclear far.ilities and so is ocr;ered under Excculm: Order 12144 md &115 wilhin !he exclusion crea!ed in the regulations at § 585l(a)(2)(D). l fumier find lite- Rcspondmt does IIOI fall under any other definition of "employer' provided in § 515l(a)(2).
