PER CL'RJA]l,f. This case arises under Section 806 of the Corporate an<l Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, Title VIII of the Sarhanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A (2010) (SOX), as amended, and ita implementing regulations at 29 C.F.K Part 1980 (2018). Complainant Peter Lindner filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) allRging that a subsidiary of ftespondent Citibank, :,,J.A. violated the SOX by rduaing to hire him for employment .

.'\fter an inve~tigation, OSIIA <lctcrmin"d that Citibank had not violated the SOX. Lindner objected and r>)quc;,;ted a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). On August 8, 2018, the ALJ issued an •'Or·dur DiHmi,;Hinf: Complaint." (Ordor) dismis~ing Lindncr's SOX claim.1 The ALJ noted that although Lindner was a prose litigant, his repeated failures to engage in discovery and comply with procedural orders warranted dismissal of his cmnplaint. 2 Lindner appealed the ALJ's Order to the Hoard.

JL"RISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW

The ARB has jurisdiction to review the, ALJ's SOX decision under Secretary's Order No. 01-2019 (Delegation of Authority and Assignment of Responsibility to the Administrative Review Hoard), 84 Fed. Reg. 1:1,072 (Apr. 3, 2019); 29 C.F.R. Part 1980.110. We review an ALi's imposition of discovery sanctions on an abuse of discretion standard.3DISCUSSIOK

Failure to comply with a judge's order may result in sanction~, including dismissal of the proceeding in who\<o or i11 part.4 An ALJ's power to dismiss a cade for lack of prosecution arises from the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition ofLindner filed a separate complaint alleging that Citibank violated the Con~umer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (Cl<'PA) when it eliminated a position he held pursuant to a contract. The AL], finding that the complaint in that case involved quoslions of law and fact related to the ea8e before us, consolidated the two cases. See Odober 27, 2017 Order Cancelling Hearing, Order Compelling Dibcovery, and Order Consolidating Cases [2018- SOX-00002 and 2017-CFP-00007]. The ALJ bifurcated the cases to accommodate an interlocutory appeal of an issue in the CFPA case. Tho interlocutory appeal is pending before the Hoard and will be addressed 111 a separate opinion .

The ALJ repeatedly warned Lindner of the consequences of his failure to comply with the AT.J's orders, including dismissal of his complaint. On appeal Lindner has failed to present any argument that compels us to reverse the ALJ's ruling. Accordingly, we hereby ADOPT the ALJ's Order, attach it to this document, and DEI\'Y Lindner's complaint.

This proceeding arises under, and has been docketed for a hearing before the United States Department of Labor, Office of Administrative Law Judges ("OALJ"), pursuant to Section Oxley Act of2002 ("SOX''), as amendffi, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, and the implementing regulations at 29 C.

PROCEDURAL HlSTORY 1

On October 5, 2017, !he U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational and Safety Administration (·'OSHA"), informed Complainant that his complaint against Respondent was dismissed. OSHA found. in pertinent part, that Complainant filed a whistleb[o,,,,er complaint against CitiMortgagc' with the Kansas City, Missonri, office. on August JI, 20 16, a case that was eventually dismissed.' '!hey 00007, which contain in-depth descriptions ot the pmcodural b1stor; ol thi, ca,c, arc herein incorporated by rcfrrcnce.

On August l, 2017, I issued a Notice uf lksnng and Preheoring Order ["No,ice of I !earing .. ), among other thing, di,cu»ed further noted that, in this instant complaint, Complainant alleged that he hand-delivered a resume and application letter lo the facility mailroom at the Long Island office of Respondent, CitiBank, on December 15, 2016. Complainant alleged that he was never contacted with regard to his application,' aml two weeks later, on December 29, 2016, filed the current complaint, alleging that he suffered the adverse action of blacklisting as a result of the whistleblower complaint t1otcd above. OSHA, however, dete!lllined that ·'Respondent has demonstrated by clear and convineing evidence that Complainan1·s protected activities did nut contribute to the adverse action. There is no reasonable cause to believe that Respondent violated SOX.'" (OSHA October 5, 2017 Letter).

Fly facsimile dated September 26, 2017. and swt to the OALJ, Complainant appealed OSHA·, decision, requesting an in-person hearing in New York City.' This matter "'as subsequent])· docketed, and assigned to me on October 16, 2017. On Octokr 24, 2017, I issued a Notice of Assignment, Notice of Hearing, and Initial Prehearing Order. Among other discovery requirements, the parties were ordered to provide initial disclosures within 21 days of the date of the Order, and the relevant regulations were pro,ided.

On October 19, 2017, Complainant filed a Motion to Postpone in the now-stayed 2017- CFP-00007 matter, slating that he was unable to access his e-mail and was having c-0mputer issues resulting in Respondent not recei,ing items from him. He requested the fo!lllal hearing be continued until January 2018. I issued an order granting hi~ Motion to Postpone on October 27, 2017.' Both of Complainant"s cases were conwlidated at that time due to a !hen-perceived commonality of questions of law and foci and the November 29, 2017 hearing was cancelled.' At that lime, however, I issued an Order Compelling Disc,wery, denying CitiMortgage's Motion to Dismiss case 2017-CFP-00007, and ordering Complainant to '·comply with the discovery requirements in case 2018-SOX-00002. Complainant is hereby notified that failure to romply with this Order may resull in sanctions, as contemplated by the regulations."' I further ordered anOn November 29, 2017, the p,irties had a lengthy on the record conference call with the undersigned. During this call. Complainant requested an extension of discovery deadlines due to bdo", scheduling lhc hearing in this matter for November 29, 2017, in Nos, York, '-:c" Y urk.

' II appears. based on information provided by Complamanl that. in addition to the official letter dated October 5. 2017.

This extension was granted during the November 29, 2017 c-0nferencc call, and the parties were given until January 26, 20 1 8 to propound discovery.

On January 8. 201 l!, C<:>rnplainant filed a request for an extension of time, stating that Respondents had yet to give him data in the fom, ofeleclronieally stored information, which was not required by the undersigned. On January 25, 2018, Complainant filed a "Ll.'.1lcr of Clarification on Order Citibank and Ogletree." In this filing, Complainant requested an extension of time for discovery due to his personal computer still not functioning. On January 31, 2018. Complainant filed his "First Motion for Extension:' In !his request Complainant alleged that he needed an extension of discovery deadlines due to his having the flu and ·'many other reasons."On March 22, 2018, 1 issued a Supplemental Prehearing Order (as part of a larger order}, wherein the parties were instructed that an in-person, on the record discovery conference would take place in New York City on April 9-1 IJ, 2018.' The parties were instructed that:

No later than April 2, 2018, each party shall provide (he undersigned administrative [av, judge and the opposing party with a brief synopsis of any outstanding discovery issue<;. This is not intended to be the parties' exhaustive arguments, but rather a notice document to facilitate an efficient discussion of the issues at the conference. The par(ic~ shall submit separate filings for Ca.se No. 2017-CFl'-00007 and Case No. 20 I 8-SOX-00002. Due to the imminent hearing date, the parties may submit the requirecl filings to the court ,·ia facsimile so long as the filings do uot exceed IO pages. (March 22, 2018 Order Severing Cases, Order Regarding Respondent's Motion for Summary Decision, and Supplemental Prehearing Orders at 9) {emphasis in original).

On March 31, 2018, Complainant filed his ''Second or l'ossibl} First Request for Delay Until Citibank Tums Over Plaintiffs Discovery Documents." On April 5, 2018, I denied this request, in part noting that the April 9-JO, 2018 discovery conforcnce wa, set for that pulJ!ose.'During the April 9-10.2018 discovery conference, Complainant, on multiple occasions, requested a continuance of the fonnal hearing date of June 27, 2018. J le stated that he believed the hearing dale was too soon and also noted he was running for Congress. in At that time, I ordered Complainant to respond to Respondent's November 21, 2017 discovery requests, on or ' 'I echnicolly • hearing on the issue of equitable rolling in case 201 7-CFP-00007 wok place un Apnl 9~ snd a disco,,ery conference on both ms,l<r> luok place on Apnl JO~, bul bolh issue, were discussed on both day,.

- 3 - before May 9, 2018. 11 I memorialized that requirement in an April 11, 2018 Order due to Complainant's refusal to comply with an oral order of the court.

With regard to discovery in this matter, Complainant was instructed numerous times by the undersigned on how to respond to interrogatories and document requests. With regard to interrogatorie;, Claimant was instructed:

[W]hat I what I said was that you need to file this in a single document, titled •'Complainant's Answers to Respondent's First Set of Interrogatories." And you need to go question by question and answer if you can. lfyou cll!lnot, you need to put in there, like you said, NIA, cannot, whatever your answer is, there has to be an answer. There can't be a blank. If you have an objecti,m toil, !hat is something that you raise with me. l do not want you to do this on the fly. (Discovery Conf. Tr. at 262).

With regard to Respondent's request for production of documents, Claimant was inslrnctcd:

It appears that there are 22 requests for production of documents. So you are going to have 22 sections of a second document. You're going lo have one [A]nswers. It's going to be called, Answers to lnterrogatories. The second one is going to be the production of documents. And you're going lo have 22 subparts of that. And you're either going to be putting documents behind each number, or I would recommend putting a page in there that says that you don'l have any, however you want to phrase it. But that you don't have documents that answer to that. And Respondent will let me know whether or not that's actually - they can file a motion to compel if they believe that - if they don't believe that that's accurate or believe that they haven't got what they want. The same that you will be able to do.

{Discovery Conf. Tr. at 270).

Additionally, 1 noted:

Okay. So, that's what I would a~k Mr. Lindner is thal you do the same with those documents and interrogatory requests. So, just lo sum it up, interrogatory requests should be in a document titled, "Answers to Interrogatories." Like I said, you could probably do a Google search and see how different attorneys or different people style or format them. Some people like to reiterate the question so that it's very clear in one docum~nl what you're answering to, and not have something - very clear. Herc is the question, and here is the answer to my 4uestion. That needs to be in one document. It needs lo be sworn under oath. Almost like an affidavit. And then the documents, you just can put some sort or cover lcltcr saying that this is Complainant's answers to the Respondent's production for documents and then " During the on-thc~rccord Di>«"ery Confer<nce, Complainant stipulated that h~ has failed 1G respond to Respondent's first ,cl of ,nlcrrogalones and diS<overy requests. (Discovery Cnnf. Tr. at 250), just number each one, so they knov, that what you've provided here is in answer to this, What )Ou've provided here, is an answer - is producing documents that you think is related to this, If there is no • if you don't have documents related to something.just note it on there, Number three, not applicable, don't have, (Discovery Conf, Tr, at 285-286),Complainant was clearly instructed, both in person at the discovery conference and in the April 11, 2018 Order Reiterating Discovery Deadlines, to submit responses to Respondent's Interrogatories and Document Requests by May 9, 2018. Complainant was also warned regarding the ramifications of his failure 10 comply with my discovery Orders, as noted belov,:

JUDGE BLAND: ... fTlhere's still discovery outstanding in that and once that diswvery and I would encourage you to focus your first efforts on answering those interrogatories and production of documents, and once that is closed then we'll detennine whether or not more evidence. whether or not [Respondent] has questions on behalf of her client and then we'll continue from there, But the first order of business - this case cannot move forv,ard until discovery is complied with and if you do not respond lo discovery, there arc sanctions and one may well be that the case is dismissed and so --MR. LINDNER: That's what I'm afraid of.

JUDGE BLAND: It behomes you -- well, but v,hat J"m saying is it is in your control as to whether or not you ansv,er these questions. (Discovery Cont". Tr. at 323).

On April 20, 2018, Complainant filed a Motion to Delay Dates Due to Running for Congress ("'Motion"). In his Motion, Complainant:

[R]equest, that all dates by This Honorable Court be extended by at least 2.5 months, due to the fact that J'm running for US Congress in NYC, and have filed my papers to be on lhe ballot for the primary election of June 26, 2018. Preparing for the election and preparing for the planned June 2018 hearing is too o,er!apping, especially since I'm representing myself.

Motion at 1 (footnote indicating that Complainant filed his papers with the Hoard of Elections on April 12, 2018, and A pri I 19, 2018, omitted). Complainant reiterated his continuance request six days later in an April 26, 2018 Second Re4uesl for Hearing Delay Until a Month After My June 26, 2018 Primary Election, noting that his April 20, 2018 Motion had ''not been answered, and is already causing me trouble."On May l 1, 2018, I issued an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Complainant's Moticm(s) to Uclay Dates Due to Running for Congress. In this Order, Complainant's continuance request was again granted, and the fonnal hearing date was rescheduled from June 27, 2018 to October 10, 2018. Complainant "as al," given an extension to file responses lo • 5 •Respondent's November 21, 2017 lnlerrogatories and Document Requests. Specifically, Complainant v,as given an additional month, until June 15, 2018, to tile the r,:,quired responses to discovery and was told if he did not fi!e responses by June 15, 2018, his matter would be dismissed.

On June 12, 2018, Complainant filed a Request for Delay on All Deadlines, which is reproduced in full (v,ithout ~ignature block) below:

Complainant's Motion was captioned lo both the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, including at least eight defendants. as wel! as to the United States Department of Labor, listing, in addition to the above-captioned case number, a stayed case number, and a case number unrelated to Comp!ainant"s claims. A doctor's note dated June 5,On June 22, 2018, the undersigned issued an Order Denying Complainant's Continuance Request, in which Complainant was instructed tn provide evidence that he submitted resp1mses to Respondent's Interrogatories and Document Requests on or before June 15, 2018. Complainant was given until July 6. 2018, to do so. This Order clearly stated, ''Failure to comply with this or Order or lack of compliance with my May 11, 2018 Order will result in a dismissal of this claim."On June 26, 2018. Respondent filed a Response in Opposition (o Complainant's June 12, "•led, "),forcover, I had a modical procedure that entailed me following the doctor", inslruclions o,er a 2 doy period. ond included not making any major decisioos on the 2"" da)',"• 6 .

Discovery Noncompliance. Respondent stated that Citibank ,c,>rved it.s First Set of Interrogatories and first RC(Jue,t for Production of Documents upon Complainant on or about November 21, 2017. At the time of the April 10, 2018 on the record discovery conference, Complainant still had not provided sworn interrogatory responses or "'any pleading that re.sembled a proper response to a request for production of documents."Respondent noted Complainant's April 20, 2018 Motion to Delay Dates Due lo Running for Congress and provided that, although Complainant stated numerous limes that he required e~tensions due to running for Congress. and was granted a four month continuance of the hearing for said reason. he was not on the ballot for the June 26, 2018 primary election, and did not notil)- Respondent or the Court of this ·'material chang" in circumstanct,s.'· Respond ml stated:

Citibank has been more than patient over these many months. waiting for not only interrogatory and document responses b\lt also initial disclosures (which have not been provided), and Complainant should not be permitted to purs\le his claims without being held accountable to the same proced\lral rules that apply lo Citibank. (Respondcnt"s June 26. 2018 Response in Opposition al 3). Respondent argued lhal b; operation of the Court's May 11, 2018 Order, Complainant"s case must be dismissed.

On July 24, 2018, Respcmdent filed a Motion !o Dismiss IJue to Complainant's Failure to Comply v,ilh June 22 Order. Respondent argued that Complainant has had seven month.s to respond (o discovery and has foiled to do so. Respondent further noted that Complainant did not comply with the Court's May l 1. 2018 Order dire,cting him to provid" discovery responses by June 15, 2018, and he has now also failed to comply with the Court's June 22, 2018 Order directing Complainant lo provide proof of his compliance. Respondent rniterated that C"mplainant's case must be dismissed.

APPLICABLE LAW

OALJ's general discovery provisions are found at 29 C.F.R. § 18.50 - 18.57 and 29C.F.R. § 18.60- 18.65. As noted in my October 24. 2017 Notice of Hearing, Notice of Assignment, and Initial Prehearing Order:

5. The fol lowing sets the schedule for the pre-hearing proct,durt,: a. DISCOVERY. A party may seek discovery immediatdy upon issuance of this Initial Prchcaring Order. 29 C.F.R. § 18.50(a)(I).

R. § l 8.50(a)(l )(i). Parties must complete all discovery at least 40 days prior the date ofthe evidentiary hearing. Parties should nok that most discovery requests and r<'sponses a,., ""l fil~d wilh lhc presiding judg<' until tiley am uS<Od in the procc~'tling or the judge orders filing. 29 C.F.R. § 18.30(b )(1 ).

••• c. TNITIAL DISCLOSURES, Within 21 days from the date of this order, and without awaiting a formal discovery request, the parties must provide to all other parties the documents and information set forth inAll disclosures must be made in writing, signed. and served. The parties must supplement the disclosures when required by 29 C.F.R. § 18.53(a). A party must make its initial di1clo1ures based on the information then reasonably available to it A party is not excused from making ilS disclosures because it has not fully investigated the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures. 29 C.!'.R. § 18.SO(c)(l )(vi).

The initial disclosures arc not filed with the presiding judge unless used in suppmting a motion or other request, or ifth.e judge orders filing. (October 24, 2017 Notice of Hearing, Notice of Assignment, and Initial !'rehearing Order).

DISCUSSION

As noted above, section 18.57(6)(1) allows the court lo sanction a party for failure to comply with a discovery order. The court may i.s.sue other '1ust orders," including an order of dismissal. The lower court's decision will be overturned only for an abuse of discretion. Af{iwal v. Mui Island Mortg Corp., 555 F.3d 298. 302 (2d Cir. 2009). When assessing whether a lower court properly exercised its discretion in dismissing a case the reviewing court generally !ooh to: (I) the wil!fulnc~, of the non-c-0mpliant party: (2) the duration of the noncompliance; (3) whether the non-compliant party had been warned; and (4) the efficacy of lesser sanctions. See Gug!{enheim Capital, U.C v. Birnbaum, 722 F.3d 444,451 (2d Cir. 2013); Agiwa/, 555 F.3d, at 302.13WillfulnessThe undersigned ;, mindful that Complainant is proceeding as an unrepresented litigant, and it is for this re&<,n that the Court has excrc;scd considerable patience in guiding Respondent through the pn1cess - despite Respondent's valid obj()Ctions. Nonetheless, the Court's patience is nllt boundless, and Complainant's .~talus as an unrepresented litigant does not excuse him from following orders, parlicipatjng in discovery, and pursuing his claim.

In the instant matter, Complainant was afforded multiple opportunities to (I) provide initial disclosures, and (2) provide responses to Respondent's Nov~'ll1ber 21, 2017 discovery requests. As noted above, as deadlines neared, Complainant requested multiple continuances for varying reasons. Complainant requested extensions on: January 8, 2018 (belie~ed he was entitled to discovery from Respondent in the form of ES!); January 25, 2018 (several month on- going computer issues); January 31, 2018 (tlu and ·'many other reasons''); March JI, 2018 (believed he was entitled to discovery from Respondent); April 11, 2018 (hearing too soon: running for Congress); April 20, 2018 (running for Congress); April 26, 2018 (running for Congress); and June 12. 2018 (litigation slre>s; m~dical; prior two-day dental procedure; class reunion).

In all but two instances. March 31, 2018, and June 12, 2018, Complainant's requests were granted. Jlis March 31, 2018 request was denied becau.se a discovery hearing was less than two weeks away and his issues would be addressed there." His June 12, 2018 request was " I haw also coosidered, as required in wmc Jurisd1ccwn,. whether the oprosing po1ty in the actioo is likel; !o be prejudiced hy further delay.

With regard to discovery in !his matter, Complainant was instructed numerous times in detail. step by step, on how to respond to the interrogatories and document requests. Although unrepresented, complainants are charged with executing "straightforward procedural requirements that a layperson can comprehend a~ easily as a lawyer." Jourdan v. Jabc, 957 F.2d 108, 109 (6th Cir. 1991); Fields v. Cmy. of Lapeer, 2000 WL 1720727, at *2 {6th Cir. Nov. 8, 2000) ("'it is incumbent on litigants, even those proceeding pro sc, to fo!low rules of procedure"').

Although Complainant put fonvard multiple excuses on multiple occasions, in the aggregate, I find that Complainant had more than ample time to comply with discovery and has shov,n no inabilil} to comply with discovery. 15 Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily in favor of dismissing Complainant's claim.

Durnlion

As noted above. Complainant had seven months lo prmide responses t" Respondent's propounded discovery. Significantly, I note 1ha! this is not about a simple dis~overy dispute over a discrete and contested issue. This is about C"mplainant failing to provide the most basic of initial disclosures and responses lo RespondL'Tll's first disc"very requests - in other v,ords, the fundamental building block. infonnation required in order to develop a case and, as noted at the disc,»ery conference, for the case to m"ve for.vard. Even now, more than eight months later, Complainant has }el to comply with my discovery orders, nor has he responded to my June 22, required by my October 24, 2017 Notice of llearing, This factor weighs heavily in favor of dismissing Complainant's claim,WarningAs detailed extensively above, and in the Orders and hearing/nmference transcripts incorporated herein, Complainant has been repeatedly \\•arned that failure to comply with discovery would result in the sanctions outlined in 29 C.F.R. 18.57(b)(l). Moreover, Complainant was explicitly warned on at least two occasions that 1:ailure to comply would re.suit in a dismissal of his claim. This factor weighs heavily in favor of dismissing Complainant's claim.

Efficaq of lesser Sanctions

As for the consideration of lesser sanctions, the warnings Complainant has received throughout these proceedings have not had any effect on Complainant's conduct. Each warning " It appears from Complainant's s<atemonc, and inlurmaliun pruv,dOO b; R.c,pundc"ILC Wm he did not in fact run for Cnngccss. ,..l,i<,h wa,; tl>e hos is fur severol of l>is continuance requests Pre,,ious filing, "'u, U,,s cou.-\ noced that he had liled co run tor Cong,·e« after the -\pril ~-1 !l. 201 R hearing and disoovcr)' oonfcrcncc.

Moreover, he has challenged court procedures throughout lhc process and caused unneces~ry delay. Complainant has not complied with the Court's lwo most recent Orders, nor has he filed a response to Respondent's two most recenl Motions lo Dismiss. The Court has considered lesser sanctions but concludes that nothing short of dismissal with prejudice would be appropriate. This factor welghs heavily in favor of dismissing Complainant's claim.

CONCLUSION

So far as any request related to discovery or other deadlines imJl{lsed by this court, I note !hat Complainant was given generous latitude as an unrepresented litigant. Over Respondent's e1mtinued objection, Complainant received multiple extensions due to illness, technical difficulties, a reunion, litigation induced stress, v,ha! he believed v,ere shortcomings in Respondent"s discovery compliance, and his alleged congressional campaign. While I am nol un-sympathctic to Complainant's health issues am! pasl technical problems, he had seven months lo ~amply with initial discovery requests but sho"·ed no inclination to provide an)thing from the simplest initial disclosures on through any answers to Respondent's long-propounded discovery request,.

Complainant brought this claim and has the burden of pursuing his claim. Part of that burden is complying with court orders and participating in discovery. Upon consideration of Respondent's request to dismiss this matter, I find good cause to grant lhis most extreme of remedies. See Carr v. Mwm, Cnty. Jail, 2006 \VL 2987823 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 17. 2006) (dismissal of unrepresented plaintiffs case as a result ofplainlifrs failure to participate in dise1wery and failure to am,wcr interrogatories): .l'ee al.m Bentknw.,ki v. Scene Magazine, 637 F.3d 689, 697 ( 6th Cir. 2011) ( identifying failure to provide inilial disdo.sures as sanctionable conduct).

For tbe aforementioned reasons, Respondent's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. and Complainant's 2018-SOX-00002 claim is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. The hearing scheduled for October 10, 2018, in New York, New York. is hereby CANCELLED.

SO ORDERED.
