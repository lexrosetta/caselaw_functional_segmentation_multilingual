L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-8.txt,68,"Despite Respondent Rotan’s instruction to attempt shift the load,Complainant refused to attempt the maneuver and actually determine how much weight could be redistributed.48 Instead, she chose to drive the load (while overweight) to the Comtrac facility where she dropped it off.49We find it undisputed that Complainant was neither instructed, nor permitted to drive in violation of the axle weight limitations on December 18, 2015."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-8.txt,69,"With 34,600 pounds on the rear axle, she was under a clear order not to drive per her telephone conversation with Respondent Rotan."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,38,"After reviewing the evidence presented in the light most favorable to Complainant, we agree with the ALJ’s conclusion on this issue, because Complainant has proffered no evidence that any alleged protected activity contributed to his discharge."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,39,"Complainant contends his phone call with Mr. Corbett was protected activity, regardless of what was stated, because he believed DTE required the use of Ohio- based crews."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,40,"Based on this, he argues DTE had “the authority to investigate, discover, or terminate the misconduct” pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 20109(a)(1)(C).26Complainant further argues “[t]he statute protects both assisting with an ongoing investigation or providing information to someone with the authority to investigate or terminate the misconduct,” which he contends means that an investigation need not be under way “as the information provided may then trigger an investigation into the misconduct. ”27"
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,41,"Complainant contends he maintained a good faith belief thatDTE had the authority to investigate, discover, or terminate the alleged misconduct because DTE referred him back to Respondent when he asked if DTE required the use of Ohio-based crews rather than denying it.28Complainant also argues the ALJ erred in finding there was a lack of evidence that his safety concerns were mentioned during the phone call."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,42,"He cites to his deposition, taken on August 29, 2018, as evidence that he tried to tell Mr. Corbett about “the problems that there could be with this and the safety concerns” and that he offered to “send him the information. ”29However, Respondent contends no Norfolk Southern manager knewComplainant discussed any potential FRSA violations with Mr. Corbett.30Specifically, Respondent asserts that Mr. Wilson, who terminated Complainant’s employment, stated “[a]t no time during the investigation did Mr. Cole claim that he had called DTE to raise a safety issue,” but rather Complainant “was acting to enforce SMART-ID’s collective bargaining agreement. ”31The record supports Respondent’s argument that Complainant did not allege he conveyed to Respondent at any point prior to his termination any safety concerns he may have raised to Mr. Corbett."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,43,"In Mr. Corbett’s December 22, 2016 email to Mr. Grace, he detailed Complainant’s concern about a loss of jobs, and that Complainant said he wanted to give DTE a chance to respond, but did not include any reference to safety concerns.32 Additionally, during the investigation on December 28, 2016,Complainant confirmed he sought to have Mr. Corbett “confirm or deny” whetherDTE required the use of Ohio-based crews, and that he stated he was doing his due diligence pursuant to the federal lawsuit in his capacity as a union official to protect his membership and the collective bargaining agreement.33 Further, inComplainant’s January 4, 2017 email to Mr. Corbett, he re-iterated he was “trying to do [his] due diligence and give DTE the chance to respond to what was said by the [Norfolk Southern].”34 To the contrary, the first time Complainant indicated that he conveyed his safety concerns to Mr. Corbett was during his deposition onAugust 29, 2018, more than a year and a half after his employment was terminated.35The Regulations state that “[a] complaint will be dismissed unless the complainant has made a prima facie showing that protected activity was a contributing factor in the adverse action alleged in the complaint. ”36"
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,44,"Here,Complainant has failed to set forth any evidence tending to show that any NorfolkSouthern managers involved in the decision to terminate his employment were aware he allegedly raised safety concerns with Mr. Corbett prior to his dismissal."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,45,"Thus, Complainant cannot establish his safety concerns were a contributing factor to his termination."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,46,"Further, Complainant’s argument that his phone call with Mr. Corbett is protected activity regardless of what was said because he believed DTE had “the authority to investigate, discover, or terminate the misconduct” is meritless."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,47,"OnDecember 7, 2016, Complainant was served with Respondent’s complaint in theU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,48,The complaint statedRespondent decided to use Ohio-based crews and that DTE was not involved in this decision.37
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,49,"As DTE was not involved in this decision, it could not have investigated or terminated the alleged misconduct."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,50,"Further, as Complainant was served with this complaint twelve days prior to his phone call with Mr. Corbett, he cannot demonstrate a good faith belief that Mr. Corbett, DTE’s Communications Manager, had the authority to investigate, discover, or terminate any alleged misconduct."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,51,"Examining this matter in the light most favorable to Complainant, he has not raised any genuine issues of material fact that he engaged in protected activity that contributed to his dismissal."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,52,"Thus, the ALJ properly granted Respondent’s motion for summary decision."
L2 Outcome,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,53,Respondent is entitled to summary decision as a matter of law.
L2 Outcome,United_States-EN-2-34.txt,54,"Accordingly, we summarily AFFIRM the ALJ’s dismissal of Cole’s complaint. SO ORDERED."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,86,"Thus, I find the most probative evidence as to Complainant’s refusal to complete his route on 23 Jul 14 to be the actual conversation between Complainant and his manager, which Complainant secretly recorded for what he apparently anticipated would be his legal case against Respondent."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,87,"Complainant’s manager told Complainant that after the DOT medical examination, Complainant was to come back and finish the route."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,88,"When Complainant asked if the manager understood how many miles that was, the manager amended the order to finish the route to “do what you can do on the route.”"

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,90,"The evidence shows that it is more likely than not that on 23 Jul 14, Complainant’s instructions were to get his DOT physical and then finish as much of the route as he could without violating the maximum hours."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,91,"Complainant testified at hearing that he could have continued driving for another hour and a half and complete maybe one more stop, but would have been pushing the maximum hours."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,95,He was tired of working 12 hour days and only getting paid for 8.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,96,"That, particularly when combined with his previous refusals to come back to resume his route after a doctor’s appointment significantly impeaches his hearing testimony, which in itself was equivocal as to whether he could have completed more deliveries before exceeding 14 hours.[35]As noted, the ALJ stated that Mauldin was “inclined to overstate time” to “establish a potential hours-of-service violation” because he felt he “was being cheated every time he exceeded eight hours in a day or forty hours in a week.”"
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,97,"The record evidence supports the ALJ’s conclusion that Mauldin’s complaints about not getting done early and not being paid for 11 to 13-hour days “significantly impeache[d] his hearing testimony” that had he completed more stops, he would have exceeded the 14-hour limit."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-45.txt,98,"Accordingly, Mauldin failed to demonstrate a reasonable belief that he would have exceeded the 14-hour hour-of-service restriction had he completed more of his route."

L1 Background,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,27,"They indicated to the Administrator that they were willing to voluntarily apply the SCA to contractors providing ancillary services such as janitorial and landscaping services, but intended to amend their subleases with retail tenants at Freedom Crossing to delete references to the SCA."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,29,The Administrator noted that the contracts are not materially different from the type of concession contracts to which the SCA has applied for decades.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,30,"Because the Freedom Crossing contracts are contracts in the form of leases, concessions, and licenses for the purpose of providing services primarily to military personnel and their families, the Administrator found SLP’s arguments as to why the SCA did not apply unpersuasive."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,31,The Administrator prefaced his analysis by explaining that the SCA has long been applied to retail concessions on military installations.10
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,32,"The Administrator next analyzed applicability of the SCA to Freedom Crossing, and concluded that the purpose of the Freedom Crossing contracts is to furnish services through the use of service employees, such that the Act did apply to the contracts."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,36,"Applying the three-part test, the Administrator concluded that the contract is covered by the SCA because it was principally for services, the amount and percentage of service labor hours, including the hours and costs of the employees of the retail subtenants over 40 years as well as maintenance workers, would far exceed those for construction, and the percentage of contract costs attributable to services would also far exceed construction costs given the 40 year length of the Ground Lease and PPV agreements and theAssistant Secretary of Defense stating that it was clear from legislative history that Congress intended for the SCA to cover concessionaire contracts the government entered into for the purpose of providing services to patrons of post exchanges on military installations and a 1986 ruling that the SCA applied to a fast food concession contract between the Navy Resale and Services Support Office and McDonald ’s for restaurants on military bases. service costs associated with the operation, maintenance, and provision of retail services for that time period."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,37,"Finally, the Administrator analyzed whether the retail subleases may be considered subcontracts under the SCA."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,38,"After discussing the definition of subcontract and indicating that it is not appropriate or reasonable to define it in a cramped manner, the Administrator ruled that even defining “subcontract” narrowly, he would still find the retail subleases to be subcontracts."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,39,"The PPV agreement requires SLP to maintain retailer occupancy levels for the retail facilities and enter into, facilitate, and enforce retail subleases."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,40,"Thus, the Administrator concluded, entering into the retail subleases is part of the primary contract and discharged an SLP obligation under the primary contract."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,41,"The Administrator found that the combined language of the Ground Lease and the PPV supported his conclusion as well as the references to the retail tenant leases as “sub-leases,” “sub-licenses and sub-concessions” of SLP’s prime lease, license, and concession."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,42,"In this case, the SLP and SDC argue that the SCA does not cover the PPV and the Ground Lease because the requirements of the agreements include substantial construction and property management activities and no retail operations; thus the principle purpose is not the furnishing of services through the use of service employees."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,43,SLP and SDC also argue that the subleases between SLP and third party retail tenants are not subcontracts under the SCA because the services the retail tenants provide are not covered by the Ground Lease or PPV.

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,48,"As previously discussed, SLP and SDC assert that the Freedom Crossing contracts are not subject to the SCA, because the principal purpose of the contracts is not to furnish services, but rather to develop, construct, and manage the Freedom Crossing project."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,49,The Act’s implementing regulations make clear that there is “no hard and fast rule” for determining the principal purpose of a contract.16 Determining a contract’s principal purpose within the meaning of the Act “is largely a question to be determined on the basis of all the facts in each particular case. ”17Another
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,50,SCA regulation is relevant to determining a contract’s principal purpose where the contract involves a contract that requires both construction activity and service work to be performed by service employees.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,51,"That regulation, 29 C.F.R. § 4.116(c)(1), specifically notes that “[i]n such a case, if the contract is principally for services, the exemption provided by section 7(1) will be deemed applicable only to that portion of the contract which calls for construction activity subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.”"
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,52,"Regarding this, the regulation under the heading “Service or maintenance contracts involving construction work,” states further:"
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,53,The provisions of both the Davis-Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act would generally apply to contracts involving construction and service work where such contracts are principally for services.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,54,"The Davis–Bacon Act, and thus the exemption provided by section 7(1) of the Act, would be applicable to construction contract work in such hybrid contracts where: (i) The contract contains specific requirements for substantial amounts of construction, reconstruction, alteration, or repair work (hereinafter referred to as construction) or it is ascertainable that a substantial amount of construction work will be necessary for the performance of the contract (the word “substantial” relates to the type and quantity of construction work to be performed and not merely to the total value of construction work (whether in absolute dollars or cost percentages) as compared to the total value of the contract); and (ii)"
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,55,"The construction work is physically or functionally separate from, and as a practical matter is capable of being performed on a segregated basis from, the other work called for by the contract.[18]Thus, in rendering his decision, the Administrator noted that pursuant to the regulations, “factors for consideration which are clearly relevant in determining if the contract is subject to the SCA include the stated purpose(s) of the contract, the amount and percentage of service labor hours performed on the contract, and the amount and percentage of contract costs attributable to services. ”19"
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,56,"Reviewing the Administrator’s treatment of these factors, we conclude that he properly determined that the principal purpose of the Freedom Crossing contracts is to furnish services and that it is therefore subject to the SCA."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,57,"In the first place, the Administrator noted that operation of Freedom Crossing involves the provision of a substantial quantity and variety of services through the use of service employees including those provided by fast food outlets and other dining establishments, personal care salons, dry cleaning, and others."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,60,The SCA covers these services.21
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,61,The Administrator rejected SLP and SDC’s arguments that the principle purpose of the contracts was not services because it did not provide these services directly (and that the purpose was “creation and long- term operation of Freedom Crossing.”).
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,62,The Administrator reasoned that the various services contemplated by the contracts could not be segregated as SLP and SDC asserted they should be.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,63,"Because the purpose of Freedom Crossing is to provide retail services to military families, “creation and long-term operation” of Freedom Crossing, also has furnishing of services by service employees as the principal purpose."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,64,"Further, the Ground Lease states that the premises “shall be used for purposes of operation, maintenance, repair and rehabilitation of the improvements to be constructed on the Premises,” and the PPV states that its purpose is “to develop and manage construction and operation of the Project,” which anticipates both construction and service-related work."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,65,"Secondly, the Administrator examined the amount and percentage of labor hours and contract costs performed under the contract."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,66,The Administrator considered the work performed by employees of the contractor and by subcontractors.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,67,"While the record did not show the amount and percentage of service labor hour or contract costs, as compared to construction labor costs, the Administrator looked at the 40-year lease term and PPV agreement to determine that the service labor hours and costs associated with the operation, maintenance, and provision of retail services at Freedom Crossing will far exceed construction costs."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,68,We determine that the Administrator had a reasonable basis to conclude that the principal purpose of the Freedom Crossing contracts was to furnish services.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,69,"Finally, we conclude that the Administrator reasonably determined that the retail subleases are subcontracts under the SCA."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,70,That the retail subtenants will provide retail services is a part of the primary contracts.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,71,We agree with the Administrator that reference to the retail tenant leases as subleases of SLP’s prime lease also supports the conclusion that the parties understood the retail tenants to be operating a part of SLP’s contracts.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,72,"Therefore, we hold that the Administrator’s determination that the principal purpose of the Freedom Crossing project contracts is to furnish services was a reasonable exercise of the Administrator’s authority."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-46.txt,73,We also hold that the retail tenants of Freedom Crossing are subcontracts under the SCA.

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-57.txt,63,"But as the ALJ held, the Administrator actually made “no determination” of a violation under the 1987 definition regulation as a result of the 2007 investigation, due to the lack of “guidance” at that time regarding the definition, which “does not necessarily mean that the [Administrator] . . . endorsed [Overdevest’s] practices at that time.”47"

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,130,Garrett’s September 5th email contains many statements.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,131,The September 5th email was an accusation and an admission of liability for driving with defective turn signals (“illegal truck” and “DOT violation”).
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,132,The email also charges Bigfoot to be better about safety in the future in terms of what should have been done before the accident.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,133,"The STAA protects complaints “related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security regulation, standard, or order.”"

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,135,"But the ALJ found that Garrett failed to show he reasonably believed that his complaints in the September 5th email constituted safety violations, when viewed in context of Garrett’s other actions and his complete lack of credibility. D. & O. at 22-23."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,136,The ALJ credited Gile’s testimony that Garrett never mentioned turn signals in connection with the accident until the September 5th email. D. & O. at 23.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,137,"The ALJ concluded that Garrett did not make any oral complaints of turn signals prior to August 3rd, did not make a complaint on August 3rd, and found dubious the August 14th DVIR."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,138,"For similar reasons, the ALJ denied protected status to theSeptember 5th email."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,139,The ALJ credited Bigfoot’s position that Garrett made up the turn signal complaints after the accident to shift liability.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,140,The ALJ cited Bigfoot’s repair history and Garrett’s lack of credibility for the absence of evidence that Garrett possessed a reasonable belief thatBigfoot violated commercial motor safety and standards.

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,145,"Assuming for the sake of argument that Garrett proved he engaged in protected activity as alleged in July, August, and in the September 5th email, the ALJ also analyzed the causation element of Garrett’s complaint, ultimately finding that Garrett failed to show that his activities, if protected, “were a factor Respondent weighed in making the decision to terminate” Garrett’s employment. D. & O. at 24."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,146,"While recognizing that the temporal proximity between Garrett’s protected activity and his firing could raise an inference of causation, the ALJ nevertheless explained that intervening events vitiated the strength of the inference. Id. at 24-26."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,147,"Specifically, the ALJ found that the repair invoice dated July 23, 2014, and the inspection report dated July 26, 2014, supported Gile’s testimony that Bigfoot promptly addressed necessary repairs and, further, that the turn signals on Garrett’s truck were repaired by that time."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,148,"So that, even assuming Garrett’s complaints about the turn signals were protected, Bigfoot’s record of prompt truck repair following identification of problems undermined Garrett’s claim of retaliatory animus. Id. at 24."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,149,The ALJ also considered Garrett’s August 3rd accident as an intervening event and found that Garrett’s changing account of the circumstances surrounding the accident both undermined his credibility and supported Bigfoot’s justification for his firing. Id. at 26.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,150,The ALJ found that Sherman fired Garrett because his email conflicted with the earlier accounts of the events of August 3rd and the police report.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,151,"At a safety meeting on September 4th, Garrett learned for the first time that the driver of the other vehicle involved in his August 3rd accident was making an insurance claim against Bigfoot."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,152,"Sherman believed that Garrett changed his story shortly after that meeting in an attempt to deflect blame from himself and either keep his job or file his own injury claim against Bigfoot. D. & O. at 10; Tr. at 54-64, 75; JX-2."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,153,The fact that Garrett admitted a DOT violation “[d]idn’t help his cause.” Tr. at 69.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,154,The ALJ concluded that Bigfoot’s termination reason was not pretext for retaliation and that Sherman’s consideration of the September 5th email was based on inconsistent statements and not on protected conduct. D. & O. at 25.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,155,"According toGarrett’s first story, turn signals had nothing to do with the accident."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,156,"He was driving straight ahead, heard a flat tire, exited the interstate, and a car was under the truck."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,157,"Even if the turn signals were not working by switch, he used them manually and testified that he did not think manual operation of the turn signals constituted a safety violation. D. & O. at 8, 22; Tr. at 210; JX-2."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,158,"But, as the ALJ found, “[Garrett’s] account of the accident soon changed.” D. & O. at 25."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,159,In theSeptember 5th email
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,160,"Garrett claimed the turn signals did not work, that Bigfoot repeatedly failed to repair them and that, therefore, Bigfoot shared responsibility for the accident."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-76.txt,161,The ALJ’s holding that Bigfoot terminated Garrett’s employment solely for switching his story and his role in the accident on August 3rd is supported by substantial evidence.

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-82.txt,62,"That is, the Court held that the reference to ''.judicial power"" in the Eleventh Amendment did not limit applicability of the Amendment to federal courts, and the States' immunity also applied to adjudications in federal administrative . agencies."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-82.txt,63,"In reaching that conclusion, the Court determined that the role of an ALJ is functionally comparable to that of a trial judge; that administrative adjudications and judicial proceedings share numerous common features, such as adversarial proceedings, a neutral fact-finder, the presentation of oral and documentary evidence, the preparation of a transcript and the pleadings to constitute the exclusive record for decision, and the requirement for findings and conclusions on all issues presented on the record; and that FMC adjudications specifically are similar to trial court proceedings, with rules of practice and procedure similar to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, discovery that ""largely mirrors"" discovery in federal civil litigation (with depositions, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, among other aspects), and a presiding ALJ whose role at the hearing is similar to that of an.

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,107,Cerny argues on appeal that Triumph decided to terminate him within hours of receiving the APU tail cone checklist on April 2 and that Triumph’s claim to have decided to terminate him before that day was pretext for several reasons.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,108,Cerny argues that documentation shows that Triumph extended his contract in March and viewed Cerny as a “vital member” who was “needed for his Embraer work during this crucial phase of engineering release.” CX-10.

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,111,Cerny points to post-termination statements made by Whittaker and Triumph’s President which Cerny argues support his claim of pretext.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,112,Cerny further claims that the ALJ erred under AIR 21. D. & O. at 43. in finding that Triumph decided to fire him before April 2 because Whittaker answered in an interrogatory response in 2016 that the decision was made on or about April 2.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,113,"Finally, Cerny offers evidence and argument that his work and performance were not deficient."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,114,"Notwithstanding these assertions, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ ’s finding that Triumph decided to terminate Cerny for performance reasons before he submitted his APU tail cone checklist report on April 2."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,120,"Because the decision was made before April 2, Cerny’s APU tail cone checklist submitted on April 2 could not have been a contributing factor in his termination."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,121,Cerny’s assertions on appeal do not undermine the substantial evidence supporting the ALJ’s findings.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,122,Mueller explained that Triumph needed to renew and extend Cerny’s job in March if he were to be on-site for even a few days as his badge would not work without current credentials. D. & O. at 30.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,123,"Finally, Mueller excused the high praise in Cerny’s March extension letter as boilerplate used in document, which indicates that Mueller and Whittaker were preparing Cerny’s termination on that date, is a forgery because it contains irregularities including the fact that Mueller’s signature is not on the e-mail though his e-mails usually contain signatures."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,124,"In further support of this claim, Cerny points out that Mueller and Whittaker testified that they intended to fire Cerny in the “a.m.” but the document circulated in the March 27 e-mail stated that he will be fired in the “p.m.” The ALJ did not find these arguments compelling. D. & O. at 61."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-90.txt,125,We conclude that the ALJ did not err and that his findings are supported by substantial evidence for the reasons discussed above.

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,25,"On appeal, Respondent challenges the ALJ’s conclusion that the employee protection provision of the NTSSA are applicable to employee’s complaints of workplace safety concerns."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,26,Hart and the SOL urge the ARB to affirm the ALJ’s decision that the protected activity in this case is covered under the NTSSA.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,27,We note that the plain language of the NTSSA protects an employee who reports safety and security concerns and is not limited to actions involving public safety or threats of terrorism.
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,28,Congress has other employer protection statutes that limit the application of whistleblower protections to the specific public concerns giving rise to a specific parent Act.4
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,29,"But in this case, the NTSSA was modeled after the FRSA and shares its implementing regulations."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,30,"The provisions relating to the FRSA have been interpreted to protect whistleblowers who complain about workplace safety, as have those relating to the NTSSA.5 As there is no express limiting language underSurface Transportation Assistance Act, 49 U.S.C. § 31105 (2007), as implemented at 29 C.F.R. Part 1978 (2018); Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, 49 U.S.C. § 20109(d)(2)(A) (2014). No. 2014-FRS-044 (ARB July 6, 2018); Mercier v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., ARB No. 13- 048, ALJ No. 2008-FRS-004 (ARB Aug. 26, 2015); Graves v. MV Transportation, Inc., ARB this Act, and safety is referred to a number of times without reference or limitation to public security or terrorism, we reject Respondent’s contention that the NTSSA does not apply to protect safety concerns that do not reach to the general public."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,32,NTSSA provides that workers who experience retaliation for engaging in protected whistleblower activities are “entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.” 6 U.S.C. § 1142(d)(1).
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,33,"Such relief includes compensation for lost vacation days as they represent terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.6"
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,34,"Accordingly, we affirm the ALJ’s conclusion that Harte is entitled to compensation in the amount of $1656, representing six days of wages at $276 per day."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,35,"With his response brief, Harte’s counsel filed a petition for fees with exhibits requesting $11,298 in attorney's fees for litigation before the Board.7 NYCTA has not objected to the amount of this request, but we have examined the petition and find the attorney's fee request to be inadequately documented and excessive."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,36,"Specifically, we note that counsel avers that he spent over 12 hours drafting and editing a brief on issues that were extensively briefed, argued, and litigated below, and were the subject of extensive discussion by the ALJ in well-reasoned decision."
L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,37,"We are unpersuaded by counsel’s assertions concerning the novelty of this area of practice, and note that the ALJ cited relevant caselaw extending back to 2008."

L1 Analysis,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,40,"We will therefore grant Harte’s request in part and order NYCTA to pay attorney’s fees in the amount of $7,698.00 for services provided by Harte’s counsel before the Board.

L2 Outcome,United_States-EN-2-92.txt,41,"The ALJ did not err by concluding that the NTSSA provides employees protection against retaliation for raising concerns relating to workplace safety, as well as public safety, and that Complainant is entitled to compensatory damages for lost vacation days."
